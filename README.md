## <div align="center">🎥🍿 Hollywoods Stories Data Analysis 🍿🎥</div>

### 🚀 Overview
This repository contains the analysis of Hollywoods Stories dataset using R and PowerBi. The dataset provides insights into movies and their profits and their ratings, the data is dated between 2007 - 2012.

### ✅ Requirements
The company I am creating the dashboard for has requested that I use their brand colours, blue, brown and green and their different shades. 

### 📊 R Analysis
In the R portion of the project, I performed extensive data manipulation tasks including cleaning and sorting to prepare the dataset for analysis in RStudio. Additionally I created a couple of charts that showed the relationship between the studios and the overall scores that they recieved for their films and how many films where produced each year between 2007 and 2012.

### 🖼️ PowerBi Dashboard
After cleaning the data using R in RStudio I then exported my newly cleaned data into PowerBi to create an interactive dashboard. The dashboard consists of five main visualisations:
1. **The average Rotten Tomatoes ratings of each genre.**
2. **The number of movies produced per year.**
3. **The audience score for each film.**
4. **The profitability per studio.**
5. **The worldwide gross per genre.**

I then had the opportunity to add in additional visualisations and cards that I would feel fit in well with the ones already created so I added:
1. **Average Rotten Tomatoes scores for each studio**
2. **The amount of films released per year**
3. **Average audience score**
4. **Average Rotten Tomatoes Score**
5. **Overall Profit**
6. **Overall worldwide gross**

With my dashboard I also included two filter boxes that allows users to select specific years or genres so that they can tailor the results to what they want to analyse.
